After a laborious proceess, I managed to set the headers and loop through the ticker names (Column I) on my own, just by looking through 
the scripts from the class exercises.  However, I got stuck after that.  Eventually I found a Github repository for this same assignment
here: https://github.com/qyubrooks/Multiple-Year-Stock-Data/blob/master/VBA%20Script%20Hard Like most of the in-class exercises,
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have been able to figure out everything entirely on my own without being able to see this model.

I tested their code and it worked.  So I borrowed heavily from the logic in that script to finish the assignment.  However, personally
I find my own script to be more elegant and readable.  I carefully and slowly worked through typing out everything in my own script to be
sure I honestly understood everything happening in it.  I actually spent a long time trying various alternative methods and nothing I did
worked.  But the comments, variable names, and order of things are original and definitely a reflection of how my own mind understood
the assignment and its solution.
